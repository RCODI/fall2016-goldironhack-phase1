3. Description of the datasets and function design
 * [name] [link] [data type] [data columns used] [data amount] http://data.indy.gov/datasets/02cb4ce73ee541a2bd6c4deba28a4e9a_6 Indianapolis parks - it shows where the parks are located within indianapolis, climate data - the basic one we have to use 
 * [Y/N] Do you use the primary dataset ”online climate data” from data.gov? Y
 * [Y/N] [List] Are all these datasets from data.gov? If not, where are they coming from (links)? Y

4. Brief Description

The website that I am designing is aimed at trying to get people outdoors, and when they are out there how to be safe. It should reference the climate data within specific parks in Indianapolis and give a reccomendation on what sort of clothes to wear, how much food and water to bring based upon estimated length, and amount of calories expected to burn within estimated time length. Displaying all of these factors with ease will hopefully make it so that people are more willing to go outside and get excersize.  

 Fill in the structued description:
 * Map View:
	1. [Y/N] Basic Map with specific location (your map is located in a meaningful place, city of west lafayette for example) Y. It will show a map of Indianapolis and display where the parks are.
	2. [Y/N] Markers for location of markets Maybe. This could be implemented later as a way to show where you could buy needed supplies for specific parks.
	3. [Y/N] Labels for markets' names If the above one is true
	4. [Y/N] InfoWindow to show detail information of a market If the above two are true
	5. [Y/N] [describe] Any other cover on the map (for example, cloud cover to show the weather effect) N. I want to keep the map as clean as possible

 * Data Visualization:
	1. [Y/N] [describe] Use Graph? What is the type? (bar chart, pie chart, radar chart ...) Y. I think maybe showing a graph comparing the amount of calories you would burn in one area compared to another could be interesting
	2. [Y/N] [List] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...) N
	
 * Interaction Form:
	1. [Y/N] [List] Any information output? list them. (text field, text area, label, plain HTML ...) A field for the temperature, estimated calories burned, and reccomended items to bring along
	2. [Y/N] [List] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience ...) search for areas with specific kinds of activities
	3. [Y/N] [List] Any information input? List them. (comments, markers, user preference ...) Intended activity and intended amount of time spent doing activity
	4. [Y/N] [List] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...) Searching for specific activties will highlight the parks that contain those
	5. [Y/N] [List] Interaction with data visualization? List them. (filter, sort, set variables ...) N. I can't think of any right now
