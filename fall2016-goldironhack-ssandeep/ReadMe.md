Description of datasets
The first dataset I will be using is the Climate Data Online. This dataset needs to be reviewed more thoroughly reviewed but overall I will be looking for data about temperature, rainfall, snowfall, storm alerts, and humidity. 

The second dataset I plan to use is the Farmer’s Market data. Based on the sample data, I am interested in using all the data columns (location, intersection, day, start time, end time, start date, end date, website, type, link accepted, latitude, longitude, and map).

I also plan to explore visualization libraries more. I am currently deciding whether to use the D3 library http://d3js.org/ mentioned in class. However since my programming skills are very basic, I will also be exploring other possible ways to visualizing my data like www.highcharts.com or www.anychart.com.

Another dataset I am still exploring is transportation.  

Yes, I will be using the primary dataset “Online Climate Data” from data.gov

All the datasets listed above are from data.gov

Brief Description
This web based application integrates Google Map API with open datasets to provide features that will help local food markets find cheap and fresh local produce. These features include farmer’s market information, location services, weather services, and transportation. 

Map View
A basic map will be shown defaulted on the West Lafayette area with a range that extends into Indianapolis as well. 

The map will include markers for the location of the markets as well as the markets’ names.

I am looking into also implementing an information window that will display detailed information about each market shown on the map. 


Data Visualization
I will most likely be using bar graphs and pie charts that are interactive. The user will be able to hover over the individual sections in the graphs to view the exact numbers/data.

Interaction Form
Information Output: The market’s website will be outputted to the user

Operation Filter: The user will be able to filter by market name and location (mile radius from a location)

Information Input: Markers will be placed on the map based on the user’s current location

Interaction with Map: The user will be able to filter by price

Interaction with Data Visualization: Will further explore

Build Case
I plan to only use HTML/CSS/Javascript. However, since I am new to web development I stil need to do some further exploring. If additional dependencies are used later in the project, they will be reflected in the ReadMe files accordingly. 

Test Case
I plan to test my project using only Chrome

Additional Information
Since I am new to web development, there is a bit of a learning curve in the beginning. However, the tutorials provided for us through GoldIronHack are proving to be very useful as well as other online sources such as w3schools.com. As the project phases pass, I will keep updating the ReadMe files with more information as I am learning.
