 Chance of Grain's purpose is to connect the user to their local Farmer's Market in West Lafayette. The site also includes climate reports(Focusing on Precipitation and Temperature) and aims to help influence buying decisions by comparing current rainfall, to needed rainfall. To clarify, if it hasn't rained well and been blazingly hot in the local area, then crops probably aren't doing as well as they could be doing. This in turn can influence a raise in pricing of local crops. This is especially true if a weather hazard has been through the local area and destroyed crops or farm equipment. If the rain hasn't been doing so well, it will advise the user to seek out a local chain super market, as those prices may be lower than the local farmers'.
 
 The user can also change to a precipitation map and view how much rain the local area has gotten in the past month.
