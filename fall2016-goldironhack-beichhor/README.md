## Datasets 

[Annual Climate Data Online for West Lafayette](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/ANNUAL/locations/ZIP:47906/detail): This is climate data that will be used alongside price to determine how weather affected prices.

[Organic Prices](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/organic-prices.aspx): The data here is the price and calculating the cost for each type of vegetable for each month. 

I will be using the primary dataset ("Online Climate Data") from http://www.data.gov.
 
## Brief Description
VeggieTables will assist consumers by predicting the price of produce for a given time period along with it's 'freshness'. The cost will be determined through historical data, and it's freshness will be correlated through climate data and will also be predicted using other historical data. I will also attempt to locate which stores are more likely to have higher quality food through public ratings and other consumer reports. 

 Fill in the structued description:
 * Map View:
	1. Will be in West Lafayette
	2. Will show locations of markets with names, with average rating.

 * Data Visualization:
	1. More than likely bar graph
	2. Interaction on graph will toggle types of vegetables
	
 * Interaction Form:
	1. Output prices, ratings, etc, based upon map location.
	2. Filter by price, freshness, and rating
	3. Search by store.

## Build Case
No external dependencies are planned as data will be access using JSON files and API's available. 

## Test Case
This project will be built using Chrome.
