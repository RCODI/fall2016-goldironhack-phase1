Easy shopper

I design this website to help people get fresh and cheap vegetables and fruits easily in different counties in Indiana. They can get information about price and production of different vegetables and fruits in different time so that they will know when can they get seasonal vegetables and fruits.


Idea

1.	I create a map of Indiana in different county.
2.	When users mouse over different counties, it will show up detailed information about this district.
3.	When users click into the county, it will appear a new page which enlarge the county map and show up the location of different grocery stores, like Walmart, Payless, Meijer, etc.
4.	When users click different grocery stores, the detailed information about address, phone number, open hour will show up.


Dataset

According to my idea above, I need two datasets. First, climate data of Indiana counties. Second, price and production data of fruits and vegetables. 

-Climate Data Online

http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/selectlocation

I will collect specific climate data for different counties from this link.

-Data Gov

This is a very comprehensive dataset about price and production of food.
