    Name is still a work in progress but will relate the data sets to the problem statement.

    Keywords: price, transportation convenience, compare markets.

    Description of the datasets and function design
        Will use the primary dataset ”online climate data” from data.gov. The other dataset tenitively is Food Environment Atlas from data.gov https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/food-environment-atlas-f4a22 .

    Brief Description
        Maybe a three part web page with a map displaying locations, local weather data to end user and a line graph which could be sorted with data. 

    Fill in the structued description:

        Map View:
            Will try to keep datasets to a national level so the app will work for folks local and in other US cities. Icons will be simple pin tops which wil be easy for moble users to click on them and access more information.

        Data Visualization:
            Would like to have a line graph which will be buildable for the end user with combo boxes that could provide a querey by example. 

        Interaction Form:
            Filter serch, change center of map, weather forcast, maybe add to shopping list with an email/print option. 

	No build notes at this time. 
	
    Will test on most browsers.
