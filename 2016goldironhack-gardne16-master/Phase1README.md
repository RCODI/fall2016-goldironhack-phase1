1. I have not yet decided on a name for my application
2. Some keywords that will describe what I hope to accomplish with this application are freshness, pricing, and seasonal availablility.
3. I plan on using datasets from the data.indy.gov and the climate data to create an application that will be useful to the locals here when they 
wish to find fresh vegetables.
In order to display this data I was thinking about trying to use google api in order to show the location directly on the map and then use 
some form of a bar graph to display how the vegetables availabilty correspond to a given season or weather condition.
4. So far I have not really thought about about how exactly I wish to lay out the application but I plan on doing so in the next couple of days prior to starting code.
