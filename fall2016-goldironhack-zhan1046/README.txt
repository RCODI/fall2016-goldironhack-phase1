2. Keywords
freshness, quality, price, location convenience

3. Description of the datasets and function design
 * [name] [link] [data type] [data columns used] [data amount] Please provide a name+link+basicInfo to each dataset you have used.
 * [Y] Do you use the primary dataset ”online climate data” from data.gov? 
 * [Y/N] [List] Are all these datasets from data.gov? If not, where are they coming from (links)?

**Still deciding on datasets. Planning functionality and interface for now.

4. Brief Description

 * Use a paragraph to introduce your project.

My project will display markets on a map with emphasis on the following variables: distance, price, freshness. Bar charts will be made for each of 
these variables so the user can compare and contrast different markets for each variable. There may be added functionality for the bar charts, though it is not planned
for now.

 Fill in the structued description:
 * Map View:
	1. [Y] Basic Map with specific location (your map is located in a meaningful place, city of west lafayette for example)
	2. [Y] Markers for location of markets
	3. [Y] Labels for markets' names
	4. [Y] InfoWindow to show detail information of a market
	5. [N] [Not yet] Any other cover on the map (for example, cloud cover to show the weather effect)

 * Data Visualization:
	1. [Y] [bar chart for each variable (price, freshness, ...)] Use Graph? What is the type? (bar chart, pie chart, radar chart ...)
	2. [N] [Not yet] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...)
	
 * Interaction Form:
	1. [Y] [test fields, labels (prices, freshness value, location)] Any information output? list them. (text field, text area, label, plain HTML ...)
	2. [Y] [price, freshness, distance filter/sort] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience ...)
	3. [Y] [Food Preferences, location radius] Any information input? List them. (comments, markers, user preference ...)
	4. [Y] [Can click on markers to view more information] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...)
	5. [N] [Will purely display data for now, may add in more functionality later on] Interaction with data visualization? List them. (filter, sort, set variables ...)

5. Build Case
How can we build and access your project on a Linux/Unix machine if you use external dependencies besides HTML/CSS/Javascript?
List the dependencies you used, such as python, node.js, etc.
List the steps we should follow to build the project.
Your project will be built on Amazon Web Service, EC2, ubuntu 14.01 instance

D3

6. Test Case
Will test the project with Firefox.
